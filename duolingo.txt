Duolingo. Today I want to talk about Duolingo.
00:53
What do I think about this platform?
00:56
Duolingo is a language learning platform.
01:01
You know, I am a teacher, but at the same time I am a student.
01:06
I also study foreign languages.
01:10
And I also use Duolingo.
01:14
So I think Duolingo is good anyway because
01:19
when you use Duolingo, you are learning a new foreign language.
01:26
By using Duolingo, you spend time learning a new language.
01:31
And that's a good thing!
01:33
You will get results either way,
01:37
because you are spending time on a foreign language.
01:42
When I started using Duolingo years ago,
01:48
there was a system in the lesson... there were pictures in the lesson,
01:54
and under the pictures there were words.
01:57
And I have repeated the words many, many times.
02:01
But now they've changed the system.
02:04
They've changed the method, the approach to learning the language.
02:09
Now in Duolingo I repeat whole sentences.
02:14
And it's the right thing to do!
02:16
As a teacher, I think this method is right.
02:22
Because in life, we speak in sentences.
02:27
In real life, we talk in whole sentences.
02:31
And now in Duolingo, I can practice whole sentences.
02:37
Of course you learn words, but you learn words in a sentence.
02:42
And that's a good thing.
02:44
Another thing I like about Duolingo is the audio.
02:48
I can listen to these phrases, these sentences.
02:54
And when I use Duolingo, I listen to the phrases
03:00
and repeat them out loud. Of course I don't speak perfectly.
03:07
Of course, I... my pronunciation is not perfect.
03:12
But I'm practicing speaking a new foreign language.
03:17
I listen to phrases and say them out loud. It's good.
03:25
What I like about Duolingo is that I can practice
03:30
whole sentences, I can listen to a foreign language
03:35
and repeat those sentences out loud. That's great!
03:42
Anyway, Duolingo is good for beginners.
03:49
If you're just starting to learn a foreign language,
03:53
Duolingo is a great method, a great learning platform.
04:00
But if you already speak a foreign language, your level is
04:07
already quite high, Duolingo can be boring for you.
04:14
You can spend that time and do something more interesting for you.
04:22
For example, you can listen to songs and translate them,
04:28
search for words and phrases on the Internet.
04:31
Or you can watch a movie, a TV series.
04:35
Sometimes this is difficult, I understand.
04:37
You can also talk to a partner, and that will be more effective.
04:43
Yes, the good thing about Duolingo is that you learn new phrases.
04:49
As a starter course, it's great for starters.
04:53
And you can listen. But there are also disadvantages.
04:59
Is Duolingo effective or not so effective?
05:04
Why do we forget words so often?
05:08
We learn words, but then we forget them.
05:12
Because we learn the words, but they are not relevant to us.
05:19
For example, I learn the lesson "Animals" in Duolingo.
05:23
But then I don't use those words in my life for a year
05:29
or maybe more.
05:31
I don't practice these words because they are not relevant to me.
05:38
For this reason we forget these words, these phrases.
05:43
We remember phrases only if they are important to us.
05:49
For example, when you live in a new country and you learn
05:57
the language of that country, it will be easier for you to remember the words.
06:06
Because... at the cafe you want to order coffee.
06:11
You search for the phrase on the Internet and use
06:16
this phrase every day. You order coffee at the cafe.
06:22
And, of course, you remember this phrase
06:26
because it's relevant to you.
06:30
And in Duolingo, it's artificial learning.
06:36
We learn different phrases, but we don't use them in life,
06:44
so we forget these phrases.
06:47
Many people say you should live with the language,
06:51
you should do what you like to do.
06:54
When you are passionate about a language, studying at home, for example,
07:03
like watching a YouTube channel that you like,
07:07
or looking on the Internet for beautiful songs in that language,
07:14
you are passionate about the process.
07:16
You don't notice, but you're learning a new language.
07:23
This is the reason we forget, and this is the reason Duolingo is
07:30
effective on the one hand and not so effective on the other.
07:35
You can't choose lessons, words that are relevant to you.
07:42
Yes, I watched an interesting video.
07:46
One girl came to a polyglot meeting.
07:50
And she was asking how polyglots learn foreign languages.
07:56
And all people have different methods.
07:59
Someone makes flashcards with phrases and learn phrases.
08:08
Someone writes down phrases in a notebook and repeats those phrases.
08:12
Someone reads texts and answers questions.
08:16
Someone listens to texts and tries to speak.
08:22
All people have different methods.
08:25
But the most important thing is that they do what they like to do.
08:30
That's the most important thing - doing what you like.
08:35
So if you enjoy using Duolingo,
08:39
you enjoy clicking and repeating phrases, that's fine,
08:44
you can learn the language in Duolingo.
08:49
But if you don't like it, if you do it because you have to,
08:56
you better not do it, you better find other methods.
09:01
I also heard an interesting story.
09:05
A man was learning a foreign language at home, but he didn't speak this language.
09:12
He did what he liked to do at home. He read, he wrote, he listened.
09:22
And after a few years he began to speak,
09:29
and he spoke it very well.
09:32
This means for those few years he didn't speak at all,
09:37
he just read, wrote, listened.
09:39
And at some point when he started talking, he started doing very well.
09:45
I think that's an interesting example.
09:48
Yes, a polyglot meeting.
09:51
The first is to do what you love.
09:54
he second is, of course, the method... method. This is very important.
09:59
Because if you don't know the language, you can't watch movies.
10:06
I tried it, it didn't work. I didn't understand anything.
10:12
And the third thing is regularity.
10:16
The third point is regularity.
10:19
Regularity means regular lessons.
10:22
When you learn a foreign language, it's stressful anyway.
10:27
But if you do it regularly, you develop a habit.
10:34
And then the stress decreases.
10:38
You know, you learn a new language once a week or
10:43
five times a week, as you wish, but you have regularity.
10:49
And the last, fourth point is patience.
10:54
Of course, learning a language is a process.
10:58
You do what you like, you do it regularly,
11:03
and in a moment you will see the result.
11:06
You will find that you understand this foreign language,
11:11
you can speak it... and speak it well.
11:17
The most important thing is patience, understanding
11:22
that language is a process. You live with this language.
11:29
You don't think, today I have a lesson, no... today
11:37
you want to learn a language, you do it with pleasure,
11:42
you do it with joy.
11:45
That's why a lot of people recommend looking for methods
11:50
that you enjoy.
11:53
And we're all different, we love different things.
11:56
You have to understand that, too. That's probably it!
12:00
Thank you for your attention!
